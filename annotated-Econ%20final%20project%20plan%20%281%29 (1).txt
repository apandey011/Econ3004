I want to create a stock market prediction model that forecasts short term price movements. Usually within a day’s timeframe of S&P 500 stocks. The question my data analysis is answering is given the current information, is this stock likely to go up or down over the next day, and how likely and by how much. The model will use historical data such as price, volume and volatility and may use market sentiment to create a trading strategy. Either long, short, or stay out. Success would be a positive outcome versus a simple baseline, like always invest. Great success would look like a higher return percentage than simply investing in the S&P. It would also look like a reasonable Sharpe ratio. As well as, low average absolute error between the predicted return and the actual return.   I want to build a computation model in Python that predicts short term price changes for stocks in the S&P 500. I will develop it in Python The process will look like:  1. Pull and clean the historical S&P 500 stock data from the NASDAQ market data API a. open, high, low, close, and volume 2. Engineer features a. Moving averages, momentum indicators, relative volume, recent volatility and possibly sentiment analysis 3. Train the predictive model a. Start with a regression model, then try and LSTM for sequence prediction 4. Backtest against historical periods on different stocks the model has not trained on  I am going to try and use price action, volume, volatility as well. I am going to have the model learn the relationships between these things. I will continue to update and retrain the model over time so it can adapt to new market environments. I will also have the model produce confidence scores with an explanation rather than just a buy or sell instruction.
